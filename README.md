SQL is a programming language designed to manipulate and manage data stored in relational databases.

A relational database is a database that organizes information into one or more tables.
A table is a collection of data organized into rows and columns.
A statement is a string of characters that the database recognizes as a valid command.

CREATE TABLE creates a new table.
INSERT INTO adds a new row to a table.
SELECT queries data from a table.
UPDATE edits a row in a table.
ALTER TABLE changes an existing table.
DELETE FROM deletes rows from a table.

One of the core purposes of the SQL language is to retrieve information stored in a database. This is commonly referred to as querying. Queries allow us to communicate with the database by asking questions and having the result set return data relevant to the question.
